![Why I use Qutebrowser as my Daily Browser (but you probably shouldn't)](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qx5egewjq5b4pra46csm.png)
Qutebrowser is an amazing and very unique browser. The modern browser today is filled with unnecessary
features, and qutebrowser helps eliminates that and makes browsing the web... Just browsing
the web! Like any other browser though, Qutebrowser has its cons and trade-offs.

## What Is Qutebrowser?
Qutebrowser is an open-source browser based on the QtWebEngine written in Python (which is
surprisingly fash for Python). Qutebrowser is keyboard-driven, and uses Vim keymaps (for the most
part), to boost your productivity. Similar to [dwb](https://bitbucket.org/portix/dwb/src/master/),
if you're familiar with that.

## Why Even Bother Learning Qutebrowser Anyways?
I asked the same thing. [Their website](https://qutebrowser.org/doc/faq.html) has a lot of good
reasons, but my ones are for productivity reasons. You never realize how many distractions
a modern browser nowadays has, and how much they slow you down. Qutebrowser eliminates **all** of
that and not only that, but their keybinds make it so you don't even need to touch your mouse!
That's just one small bit of why I use qutebrowser, here are some bullet points:
* Vim and Other Keybinds (insanely boosts productivity)
* Built-in ad-blocker (sadly doesn't work on YouTube.)
* It allows for crazy customization.
* The whole project is [Open-source](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser), and maintained with [donations](https://github.com/sponsors/The-Compiler/)

Ever since I started using Qutebrowser I've, seen a huge productivity boost in my developer workflow,
which is the main reason why I use it, not only as a developer but for everyday web browsing.
The customization part, while not as important, I'm a big fan of (especially as I spend hours in
my dotfiles trying to make them look as clean as possible), and I appreciate how Qutebrowser
makes it easy to make my browser look the way I want it to look.

But most importantly, qutebrowser is a browser, and nothing else. This is exactly what I look for
in a browser, I don't need a fancy start page filled with distracting ads and bloated with trackers.
And the good thing is, if you need them, then Qutebrowser makes it easy to add them!

## What's Wrong With Qutebrowser?
So I've talked about how great Qutebrowser is for me so far, but would I recommend it? It depends...

### Qutebrowser Forms 
I do have to admit, I miss auto-fill in some forms. I'm usually not a big fan of them for some
security concerns (especially when using chromium-based browsers), but I do find that they save some
time, and they are honestly useful in some cases, so hopefully, that's something that they add soon.

### Qutebrowser Security and Privacy
While qutebrowser doesn't steal your data and does try to block some trackers, it is not nearly as
much as what you can get using a Firefox or Chromium extension. Another thing worth mentioning is as
the QtWebEngine is chromium based, it does allow google to add some little sneaky things here and
there.

### Other
other smaller things are a bit annoying about Qutebrowser (mainly the lack of extensions), like no
password managers, some weird ad block problems, and videos... are just a pain, but that's not too
much of a problem with me since I don't watch YouTube on my laptop, but don't expect to get
the smoothest experience when watching videos.

## Final Thoughts & Conclusion
Qutebrowser is a great browser, and I don't see myself going back to another browser anytime soon,
but it's not for everyone, and it (like any other browser) of course has its cons.
