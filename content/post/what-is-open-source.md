## The basics
Let's start with what the actual defenition is of open-source, basiclly when something is open-source it means that *anyone* can see the code that makes that product, and anyone can contribute to it aswell. Anyone can see the code, modify, and inspect the code.

## Why Open Source?
* Open source ensures that the software that you use is secure and private (or easy to know if it's not),
* Open source allows any bug to be easily detected and fixed a lot faster.
* Everyone has different points of view of things, open source allows millions of developers from all around the world to contribute to their favourite software's code.

*BTW: this website is open-source so feel free to contribute to it! You don't need to know how to code, even a simple typo fix can help!*

## What is wrong with closed software (propietary software)
First of all, you have *no idea* how much data they are stealing from you, and how much they know about you. Since the code is not avaiblable to the public security bugs (and other bugs aswell) might go un-noticed for a long time which can lead to very security hazardous bugs being abused.
