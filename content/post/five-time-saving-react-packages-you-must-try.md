## react-icons - Library for the most famous icons
Let's start with the one that you probably already heard of or even used if you've been using React
in your projects for a while. If you haven't already, this is a MUST try. The package we
will be using is react-icons, it includes thousands of icons from the most famous providers
including FontAwesome, Feather Icons, and Material Design.

Installation:

```bash
# Using NPM
$ npm install react-icons --save
# Using yarn
$ yarn add react-icons
```

You will deffenetly find one that you will like as there are multiple options to choose from, or

## react-toastify - React notifications made easy!
I'm sure you've come across toast notifications at some point. But have you ever thought about
adding them to your website? Well, react-toastify makes that extremely easy and gives you a handful
of props for customization too. But my favorite thing about this package so far is its interactive
playground.
