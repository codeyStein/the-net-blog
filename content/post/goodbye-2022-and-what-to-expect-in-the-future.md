## My Best Preforming Articles
### 3. [Why I chose Hugo (and why you should too)](https://the-net-blog.netlify.app/post/why-i-chose-hugo/)
I am still a little suprised on how well this article preformed as it was actually my first one, I talked about why I chose Hugo to do literly this website, and why I think it's a very good option if you're looking to make your very own static site. Feel free to check it out if you want to!

### 2. [Five Underated CSS Properties You NEED To Try Out!](https://the-net-blog.netlify.app/post/five-underated-css-properties-you-need-to-try-out/)
One of the things I love most about writing articles has to be how much I learn by creating them! You'd be suprised to know how much I learn while researching for these, and this article is no exception. I'm very sure I didn't know at least half of these before creating the article.

### 1. [Five FREE Apis You Need for Your Next Project](https://the-net-blog.netlify.app/post/five-free-apis-you-need-for-your-next-project/)
Like I said with the past article, I learnt a lot, but I still remember the happiness I felt when I went through the analytics. I was very suprised when I saw how good this preformed.

## What to expect?
Apart from some personal ones, here are some of my goals for 2023: 
* First of all, as you probably didn't know, I used to post videos on YouTube (but I kinda stoped...), and now I even kind of cringe at myself looking back at those videos. But I do want to give that style of content-creation another chance.
* I deffenetly want to improve my english and grammar skills (it's not my first language), so I'd love to hear what you think of my writing skills

I don't plan to stop writing articles, or haven't even thought about taking a break anytime soon.

## Reflexion
This has been a great 2 months of a year, I really enjoyed starting writing articles and hope to continue. And I senceirly thank all of you for supporting me through this year, and I hope to see you next year too! Happy holidays!
