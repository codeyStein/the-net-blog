## My Best Performing Articles
### 3. [Why I chose Hugo (and why you should too)](https://the-net-blog.netlify.app/post/why-i-chose-hugo/)
I am still a little surprised at how well this article performed as it was my first one, I talked about why I chose Hugo to do [this website](https://the-net-blog.netlify.app/), and why I think it's a decent option if you're looking to make your very own static site. Feel free to check it out if you want to!

### 2. [Five Underated CSS Properties You NEED To Try Out!](https://the-net-blog.netlify.app/post/five-underated-css-properties-you-need-to-try-out/)
One of the things I love most about writing articles has to be how much I learn by creating them! You'd be surprised to know how much I learned while researching for these, and this article is no exception. I'm very sure I didn't know at least half of these before creating the article.

### 1. [Five FREE Apis You Need for Your Next Project](https://the-net-blog.netlify.app/post/five-free-apis-you-need-for-your-next-project/)
Like I said before, with the past article, I learned a lot, but I still remember the happiness I felt when I went through the analytics. I was very surprised when I saw how well this performed.

## What to expect?
Apart from some personal ones, here are some of my goals for 2023: 
* First of all, as you probably didn't know, I used to post videos on YouTube (but I stopped...), and now I even kind of cringe at myself looking back at those videos. But I do want to give that style of content creation another chance.
* I want to improve my English and grammar skills (it's not my first language), so I'd love to hear what you think of my writing skills

I don't plan to stop writing articles and haven't even thought about taking a break anytime soon.

## Reflexion
This has been a great two months of a year, I enjoyed starting to write articles and hope to continue. And I sincerely thank all of you for supporting me through this year, and I hope to see you next year too! Happy holidays!
