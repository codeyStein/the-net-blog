## Welcome!
Hi, you can call me CodeyStien. I am most interested in web/app development specifically using React, but I'm always excited to learn other technologies (which is actually one reason I started to write this blog). I absolutely love graphic design, and app/web design.      . If you were to ask me what my favorite stack was I'd probably say:
* Framework: NextJS
* Database: Firebase
* CSS: SCSS

And if you are interested, these are probably my favourite projects: 
* [ButtonLab - a simple web editor to create buttons (inconplete)](https://buttonlab.netlify.app/)
* [ProtectCorals - Landing page for an organisation](https://protectcorals.netlify.app/)
* [my dotfiles if you are into that :)](https://github.com/codeyStein/dotfiles)

Coding is a very big hobby of mine, but when I'm not you might find me playing around with Blender, improving my typing speed, taking a walk around around my neighborhood, and I also listen to music really frequently. I'm also learning Japanese and I've gotten into reading manga lately, so that's another thing I like to do.

## About The Blog
Ok so now let's talk about what to expect in my blogs. Basically I started this blog as a fun project (let's see if it works out), and I wanted to share some of my knowledge that I think might be useful to future viewers. I'll touch on topics such as web development, app development, design, good coding & design practices, software I find interesting, and try to educate and spread awareness of open-source.

I'm also a big fan of the terminal, so much I probably spend 90% of the time in the terminal, so I would love to share my experiences about that too.
